the freezer. it was a favorite by all. perfect for any cold and rainy day. you won't find this one in a cookbook. it is truly an original.","3":"this is a super easy, great tasting, make ahead side dish that looks like you spent a lot more time preparing than you actually do. plus, most everything is done in advance. the times do not reflect the standing time of the potatoes.","4":"my dh's amish mother raised him on this recipe. he much prefers it over store-bought ketchup. it was a taste i had to acquire, but now my ds's also prefer this type of ketchup. enjoy!","5":null,"6":"my italian mil was thoroughly impressed by my non-italian treatment of her olives. they are great appetizers and condiments to your fav pasta.(from the vancouver sun) ps. cook time include fridge time","7":"this recipe is posted by request and was originaly from chef sam choy's cookbook ","8":null,"9":"from ann hodgman's ","10":"horseradish is one of my favorite condiments as well as cranberry sauce. this is sweet and hot. i enjoy it on a smoked turkey & swiss sandwich, but also good alongside baked ham or roast beef.","11":"simple but sexy. this was in my local newspaper's food section. cook time reflects refrigeration time.  i've been asked several times if this should be baked.  just to clarify, no, it is not, it is a refrigerator dessert. i'm not sure why it contains raw egg, but most tiramisu recipes do too.","12":"i'd have to say that this is a labor of love dish, but i give you my word that this recipe is better than bush's. enjoy! oh, and also this recipe is easily doubled. in fact, i think it turns out better when it is.","13":"my boss gave me this recipe several years ago. the recipe supposedly came from the ","14":"this will prove a blessing to everyone who takes it. it is soothing and relaxing, quieting to the nerves, has many good qualities, and is perfectly harmless. you can get the ingredients from any good health food store. you could up this to 1 cup each or lessen it to 1\/8 cup each, according to your preference.","15":"here's and old standby i enjoy from time to time. it's from an old newspaper clipping i cut out years ago. very tasty.","16":"a favorite from a local restaurant no longer in business. not an authentic mexican chile relleno, but a crispy, flaky version.","17":"a little different, and oh so good. i include these when making up candy trays, as gifts, at christmas time.","18":"easy one-pot dinner. ","19":"this is a dairy free ","20":"wonderful comfort food from rozanne gold, a favorite cookbook author. this is a creamless creamed soup and it's delicious. it's made thick with potatoes and rich with butter. the color of this soup is stunning.","21":"thickened with a mix of cooked oats and vegies, this soup has all the flavor of the original with a fraction of the fat stuff. low in cholestorol too!","22":"delicious, crunchy fried chicken. this recipe came from the ","23":"my mother used to make this for us as a special treat. i don't know where she got this recipe or what it is called (hence the title). my husband loves this and encouraged me to submit it. this recipe is full of sugar and oil and is as unhealthy as a desert can be but very yummy.","24":"the secret to this easy hollandaise sauce is in separating the egg yolks. remove all the egg whites, as they can thin the sauce. also, it is best prepared in a double boiler to prevent overheating. serve over cooked asparagus, broccoli, or broiled tomatoes.","25":"really an effective spice blend...i got it in one of maharishi ayurveda newsletters and thought of sharing here !hope this will help you melt your blues away.. :-))","26":"this recipe was adapted by my mother and myself from meat chili. we fed it to my dad and only told him afterwards it wasn't meat - he couldn't tell the difference! this is a fast and filling meal and is even better, cold or warm, the next day! i serve leftovers with tortilla chips or in a wrap. also good with sour cream and\/or cheese on top.","27":"this recipe came from a ","28":"my husband made these up last week, very tasty, he liked them because they were easy.","29":"an original recipe created by chef scott meskan, george's at the cove. we enjoyed this when we visited this restaurant in la jolla, california. this recipe is requested so often, they have it printed and ready at the hostess stand. it's unbeatable at the restaurant, but i do a pretty good job at home, too, if i do say so myself!","30":"a yummy thick chocolate mint brownie from york peppermint patties! get the sensation!","31":"hey! i found this in a cookbook that recognizes different kinds of food from around the world. my brother made this in the 7th grade for 'food and consumer science' (facs, or home ec) as the meal made on his own. everyone loved it, and i came across it the other day, and decided to post it! this can be served with warm flour tortillas and additional toppings can be put on like guacamole, chopped tomatoes, or sour cream. it is your choice!","32":"buttery and ","33":"delicious venison burgers with that ","34":"my children and their friends ask for my homemade popsicles morning, noon and night. i never turn them down; who am i to tell them that they are good for them! for variety i substitute different flavours of frozen juice - grape, fruit punch, tropical etc.","35":"my friend just made this for dinner the other night. when i found out it how easy it is to make, i was shocked. trick the non-cooks in your life into thinking you slaved for them...","36":"if spinach scares you, this is one recipe that contains spinach that you do not have to be afraid of! it is so delicious that even my picky kids like it. my mother-in-law makes this for get-togethers and she passed the recipe on to me. you can also use broccoli instead of the spinach, which she does often, but i have never tried...it is great the way it is! she also eats this hot or cold, but i only like it hot :) enjoy!","37":"the name says it all. you have to try it to believe it!","38":"these were so go, it surprised even me.","39":"this is a hearty and filling casserole for those nights when a long time in the kitchen is just out of the question. very tasty and easy to make, my family requests it often. enjoy!","40":"i love mirj's funky chicken with sesame noodles. i decided to use the noodles as my inspiration for this recipe. it's really similar but totally different. we liked it and i hope others will too! cook time is the time it takes to make the pasta. *update* since posting this, i tried adding about 1\/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and it turned out wonderfully so i decided to add it as a suggestion.","41":"with so many people having problems finding the sorghum, i revamped the recipe. this version produces a sweeter and lighter tasting muffin.","42":"these muffins may have slightly different ingredients but the end result is a wonderful rich, moist muffin. the sugar sprinkled on top before cooking gives a slightly sweet crunch and cracked glazed appearance.","43":"just the thing for a day when you're wanton something delicious, and a hamburger patty is just too restrictive. loosen up your inhibitions and pile some loose meat on a bun. wicked over hot, whipped potatoes as well.","44":"this is a fun salad that uses the same ingredients you would in an italian sandwich. water chestnuts give it a nice crunch!!","45":"ok, so this is not *really* italian, but it is still great with burgers! :)","46":"my sister-in-law made these for us at a family get together. they are delicious!! a little messy to make but worth the effort!! have a helper and make an ","47":"a bakery in winnipeg is famous for this special cake and ship it to all parts of canada. a recipe request column in the winnipeg free press printed this copycat recipe submitted by a reader. enjoy !","48":"this is a very tasty, moist, carrot cake. a nice sized cake for 2 or 3 people.","49":"this is a moist, easy, colorful and delicious cornbread. roasting the corn adds a little nuttier flavor and the red bell pepper adds a nice color and flavor."},"ingredients":{"0":"['winter squash', 'mexican seasoning', 'mixed spice', 'honey', 'butter', 'olive oil',
