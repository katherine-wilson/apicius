 our kids are now teenagers and their old school friends still talk about how \"cool\" they are !","344":"even though this is an easy one--it's actually really good!","345":"be careful not to stir the crab too much into the other ingredients. best to fold the mixture gently with a spatula to combine everything. you want the big chunks of tasty crab to stay together as big chunks of tasty crab. freshly cooked blue crab is the best choice for this recipe; however a good quality canned crab is an acceptable substitute.","346":"this is one of the first dishes i served company when i became vegetarian.  everyone was astonished that this cheesy tasting lasagna didn't have any cheese in it!  i originally saw this recipe published by user submission at vegweb.","347":"this is a greek salad recipe from salad creations. this is the exact ingredients for it, very easy and its good! enjoy!","348":"this looks like a tasty treat, with a nice asian flair.","349":"i love  those chicken burrito bowls at the restaurant chipotle, and this version is just as good - to me and my family anyway! the recipe appears to be long, but it consists of mostly toppings. enjoy!","350":"light fluffy pineapple salad your sure to love","351":"good for those un\"comfort\"able aches and pains!","352":"my grandmother used to fix this when company was coming over, hence the name.  this is a very forgiving recipe where amounts of ingredients can be varied to suit different tastes (want less onion? want more bacon?it's all good).  also, it can be doubled or tripled without any harm.","353":"it just doesn't get much easier than this fool-proof rice sidedish.  it won't look like much when it goes in the oven, but trust me, it comes out perfect every time.  i've been making it for holiday dinners for years.  it takes 5 minutes or less to throw together and can go in the oven with those other last minute dishes or prepare it ahead and reheat in the microwave at serving time if oven space is a problem.  note:  the original recipe called for 1\/2 cup butter but i found that to be excessive.","354":"a light but surprisingly rich onion soup. suitable for a simple lunch or dinner if served with a hearty bread (sourdough is best) and a salad and some milk, or use it as the soup course for a big dinner and impress everyone. my dad calls it \"country style\" because he was served something very like it (although, he thinks, made with chicken or beef stock) while staying with friends in the french countryside. try to find butter with the ingredients \"sweet cream\" or \"cream, salt\" (but unsalted is better); it will taste much better. use home-made veggie stock if possible, or, if you must, canned, but taste carefully before salting in that case!  substitute chicken stock for more protein and a richer taste.","355":"this is so cute!!! place \"crab\" onto lettuce-lined platter with mound of your favorite crab dip, surround with shells and crackers if desired! great for parties, picnics and bbq's!","356":"i took this spread to a recent party, and it got rave reviews. everyone loved it, and it's pretty simple to make. i recommend making it a few hours before serving so the flavors get to blend. i served with additional cocktail sauce on the side because as it gets eaten, the top layer of sauce tends to disappear.","357":"this is a favorite of my family and friends.  one of my former roommates gave it the name \"crack\" lasagna because everyone who has had it is hooked on the stuff.","358":"we don't pay $7 a plate for lo mein any more.  this home version uses common pantry ingredients and ground beef. this is a family favorite and is inexpensive to prepare.","359":"a healthy, budget-friendly substitute for canned cream soup.  takes just minutes to whip up--perfect to use in casseroles or as a base for homemade soups, stews, etc.  it's so versatile; use as is, or add celery seed for cream of celery, a jar of mushrooms for cream of mushroom, or chicken bouillon for cream of chicken. enjoy!","360":"from \"dining in\"; i've always wanted to find a kosher \"cream of chicken soup\" recipe, and now i have one!  i had to play around a bit with the amount of liquids, especially when cooking the rice because i used an immersion blender... it might work okay as listed with a food processor.","361":"i created this recipe one evening when i wanted something just a little bit special to serve my husband. it's so simple, yet tastes so very rich.","362":"it's made with milk to keep it lower in fat, but it is a very hearty yummy soup.  goes great with a nice crusty roll, or thick slice of french bread!!","363":"this is a tasty springtime soup that is so delicious, we love fiddleheads here , and it's nice to have a few different recipes to use them.  the soup is very good.","364":"creamless but creamy, and easily adapted to vegan.","365":"we were astonished to discover that we could make a dark chocolate sauce in minutes for pennies that matched what we'd received in a $4, 6-ounce gift jar.","366":"a bunch of us were sitting around in the gatehouse of the residence inn - cedar rapids (ia).  one of the ladies was joking about turning her husband into a diamond when he died.  we were trying to think of something with a really high fat content that was high in calcium for better bone structure.  hence, diamond creme brulee, all of the calcium and twice the fat!","367":"from the recipe book the food you crave","368":"yes, this cake is made with beets! and you won't believe how great it is. i got the recipe from a friend who said it is the most requested cake in her family. even the kids want it for their birthday cake. i baked it for one of our family gatherings and now, i get lots of requests for it too. the batter looks red, but the red bakes out. i use an almond flavored frosting on it sometimes. other times i just serve it with homemade whipped cream.","369":"this is quick and easy.  from the blog www.wholenewmom.com.","370":"this is a variation of another \"dressed-up\" salad i make for special occasions.  this one is for my occasional \"irish girl's greek night\" parties, the salad makes an outstanding presentation by being totally covered with colorful vegetable rings with a circular dollop of feta cheese in the center.  after everyone ooos and aaahs, toss it and serve with your favorite greek dressing.  i use a portion of recipe #68485, the remainder of which stores nicely in frig.  i hope you enjoy this very pretty twist of a green salad recipe.  (note --  amounts below are realistic but not written in stone.  measurements also depend on the size of the salad bowl and amount of greens in it, since the salad's \"wardrobe\" has to totally cover top of greens!) i have also used thinly-sliced celery and\/or small pieces of cauliflower as part of the ring wardrobe!","371":"this recipe is a cross between a donut and a muffin. baked, not fried, using wholesome ingredients, it is actually a smart start to your day!","372":"this recipe is so named because the cinnamon sugar topping makes this pancake both look and taste a bit like an elephant ear from a carnival.  be sure to check it after 15 minutes of cooking and then every five minutes after that.  since some ovens run hotter than others, i've found it can definitely change the cooking time required.","373":"picked up this recipe at a local \"elmer's\" restaurant. it sounds so good and easy to prepare. they were giving out the recipe free so i guess it's ok to post here. i haven't tried it yet, but the card said: it takes only minutes to produce the best-tasting summer salsa ready for dipping, topping, and summertime fun. cooking time includes standing time.","374":"this is the delicious green smoothie recipe that i make and serve at my vita-mix sales demonstrations.  it always \"wows the crowd\" when something that is so bright green tastes so surprisingly delicious!  it is designed for a vita-mix so i don't know how it would work in any other kitchen appliance.\r\n\r\nadd ingredients into the 64 oz. container in the following order:","375":"easy and versitile mac and cheese recipe.  i adapted this from a recipe i found on the back of a box of elbows. i especially like that you don't cook the pasta in advance.","376":"this recipe came from the back of a nestle cocoa can. i've been making these for years, and they're always a hit. the batter is pretty thick, which makes them very fudgy. the original recipe included frosting, but i think it makes them too rich. if you have a strong sweet tooth, you might like them with the frosting. the frosting recipe is posted separately. enjoy!","377":"this delicious spice cake is a must make this fall season as the weather begins to grow cooler.  oh and did i mention it is low fat as well.  everyone i have made this for or have given the recipe to gives this cake a huge round of applause.","378":"a one in a million dish craved by thousands of attendees of the maui swap meet. it is still sought after it was discontinued when the swap meet moved to a new location.  popular toppings for this dish are grilled teri-chicken, teri-beef, shrimp curry or just with chopped green onions.","379":"while this doesn't have the authentic sourdough flavor, it still makes a tasty loaf!","380":"this recipe comes from first magazine. i haven't tried it yet but it looks pretty good. i don't usually use cornbread mix unless i'm in a huge hurry but i might give this a whirl. you could probably incorporate this into your homemade cornbread recipe.","381":"i used this on a thick filet of salmon and it worked out well. you could use other fresh fish, but it really depends on the fish.","382":"copied for the foodies cooking show.\r\nchop and measure everything before starting.","383":"after tasting similar cookies at a picnic, we excitedly left with our friend's recipe.  we were intrigued by the technique, but determined to eliminate that odd aftertaste which so often results from using splenda in baked goods.  we also wanted the finished cookie to be a bit less dry and crumbly.   a few tweaks later, we enjoyed a terrific batch of gluten-free peanut butter cookies which could stand up against the best of traditional-method cookies.   these quick cookies freeze well if you want (need) to reserve them for portion control.   and, with only 3 tablespoons of real sugar divided across 16 cookies, one (or two!) a day won't wreck your south beach or diabetic menu plan.\r\nwe are usually tempted to double the vanilla in any recipe, but here the small amount of vanilla adds a depth of flavor without interfering with the rich peanut taste.\r\nplease note that the 5 minute preparation time does not include the 30 minutes this dough needs to rest in the refrigerator.","384":"this is a lovely salad dressing from a local gluten-free cookbook. it is extremely simple and you'll (most likely) already have all the ingredients at home.","385":"a easy & no clean up way to do your bacon.\r\ni had to add a t. of pepper because you need more then 1 ingriedent, skip unless you want your bacon peppery!","386":"i revved up my sister's basic recipe for oven-fried chops. treat your family to a meal fit for company. prep time does not include marinating.","387":"from a great cooking class i took in morton, illinois.","388":"vegan french toast. i haven't tried this, i'm just posting it for safe-keeping.","389":"a recipe from ricardo that is popular with kids.  so i had to try it. my son is beginning kindergarten tomorrow and i wanted to do something he'll like.  and this recipe is a winner with it.  with us also.  it's so easy to do.","390":"this is a chocolate bundt cake with peanut butter \"tunnel\".  made to taste like drakes funny bones.","391":"tested recipes from the graubunden, by the chur chapter of the swiss women's institutes.  submitted for zwt7.  a lovely vegetarian dish.","392":"c'mon, admit it! at some time in your life, you have eaten \"hamburger helper.\" i know that it was a staple in our house when i was a kid. the little talking glove is comforting in a twisted kind of way. :o) anyway, this recipe looks like hamburger helper, but tastes much better. sure there are recipes out there that are probably better for you or tastier but when you are trying to eat quickly and on a budget, this recipe is a must.","393":"i developed this recipe to use ground turkey, which i love. it lends itself very well to oamc & is kid-friendly. great for potlucks or to take to a family when mom is ill or new baby at home.","394":"i first tasted these muffins at a brunch and the hostess was kind enough to give me the recipe.i asked her about the name she had given them, and she said if any food could ever say \"good morning!\" these muffins were it.","395":"here is a lighter version of my much loved goulash recipe.","396":"noodle beef stew in the slow cooker...easy comfort food!","397":"another of my favorite recipes that my granny made when i was little.","398":"my daughter and i are both anemic and were looking for easy and yummy ways to incorporate more iron into our diet. i'll admit they don't look really appetizing, but these eggs are light and fluffy and are great accompanied by dr. seuss' \"green eggs and ham.\"  my daughter is 2 and can be picky, so i was ecstatic that she loved these eggs and asks for them almost daily. mustard greens are an amazing source of vitamins and nutrients!","399":"light soup thats good and good for you.","400":"touchdown!\r\nthis recipe is from that's trump.\r\nit is a greay appy that everyone will enjoy.  not just for the grey cup!!!!","401":"i use this delicious fat-free method of cooking salmon, chicken and pork chops at least 2-3 times a week, varying the meats and seasonings.","402":"this delicious low-calorie dessert is a great way to satisfy your craving for a big bowl of chocolate ice cream without blowing your diet. the thickness of the greek yogurt provides the creamy texture of ice cream for just a fraction of the calories. also, by using frozen berries, the yogurt freezes as they are mixed in, giving the cool, frozen texture of real ice cream. the fiber one cereal sprinkled on top provides a nice crunch and textural contrast - enjoy!","403":"carbonite takes the shape of cheese in this flavorful savory cake, inspired by han solo.","404":"these mock \"hamburger\" buns are amazingly bread-like in texture (and taste!) and are suitable for all phases of the dukan diet! once completely cool, seal them in a ziplock storage baggie or a tupperware over night. they will totally change their consistency, to something much more like bread - a softer texture that is nice and chewy. while warm they are crumbly and similar to cooked meringue - but don't let this fool you! since the sides that were facing the pan are perfectly flat, you use these to spread things on, or make sandwiches, or even as a burger bun! my favorite is spreading cream cheese on both sides (like a sandwich) and stuffing with a freshly poached egg...delish!","405":"taken from charmaine solomon","406":"this may sound cocky, but seriously, stop looking for an amazing, homemade red velvet cake recipe because here she is!!!

italian sausage to the pasta sauce if you wanted it a meaty lasagna.","830":"potato salad from scratch in just 10 minutes, and it's low fat too. i love the creamy taste of the dressing, and the olives

surprisingly mild. i like to jack it up a bit with some hot sauce, but my family doesn't like spicy food, so i do my own at the table.","838":"fresh tasting pasta sauce using canned crushed tomatoes as described on america's test kitchens. use either muir glenn or tuttoroso crushed tomatoes because they use a lower processing temperature in the canning process and therefore are fresher tasting than other brands.  recipe notes:  according to the chefs, grating the onions instead of chopping allows them to carmelize more quickly. the butter is used because saturated fats helps the onions stay sweet. olive oil contains  unsaturated fats that react with an enzyme in the onion that can result in a bitter taste. using crushed tomatoes is preferable to other forms. the chefs apparently expended a great deal of effort in developing this simple recipe so it is suggested that it be followed closely in order to acheive a fresh tasting sauce from canned tomatoes.","839":"a jolinda hackett

excellent, and we make it if we are having soup(instead of crackers), or if we are having a salad as a meal.  it is also a thin bread, so it is great for dipping in dips.  hope you enjoy.","846":"we

just a base(a very good base by itself!); easy as pie to jazz it up with ground beef or italian sausage, extra onions, garlic, spices--whatever strikes your fancy!  higher fat or lower fat depending on if you use low-fat ricotta, parmesan, and mozzarella.  this came from a cookbook i had once, but darn if i know which one or where it even is!","851":"a new take on an old favorite - shrimp instead

time. it is very inexpensive (maybe $3 for the recipe) and takes almost no time at all. eat alone or use it as a burrito filling. omit the cheese for a vegan recipe.","975":"this is very good and quick and easy. not sure where i got this recipe.","976":"my own version of oatmeal cooked in the rice cooker. all it takes is only 15 minutes of your time :)","977":"i like bean soups since they're cheap, easy to make, and healthy comfort food.  i've never made 15 bean soup before this, but i loved the way this one turned out so i had to post it so i wouldn't forget.  it ended up being a combination of things i had around and wanted\/needed to get rid of...either way, this is yummy!  i didn't add the meat off the bone, but if you like it...feel free!  great for cozying up when it's cold or watching football (or hockey!).","978":"stovetop skillet cooking is especially handy for quick meals.  this dinner will only take a few minutes to prepare but it rewards with a big bold taste. serve it up for a weekend meal along with a tossed green salad and you will have a sure winner.","979":"who says sophisticated hors d'oeuvres have to be complicated? this pate takes about 15 minutes to prepare, yet has the flavor of centuries of old world tradition. can be made several days ahead of time.","980":"i made up this recipe myself, so hopefully it isn't a repeat.  my husband loves this

you come home.  i love the packages with 16 kinds of beans...they make the best bean soup.  they don't come with a prepackaged mix or anything like it sounds--the 16 bean soup mix is just a package of 16 kinds of beans.  i didn't have turkey italian sausage so i used regular spicy italian sausage, and i added a couple potatoes just because i love them.  recipe is posted as written.  serving size is estimated.  recipe courtesy of www.lovetoknow.com","990":"my mother got this from her sister, martha. it's a tried and true pickle recipe. it's very similar to recipe #17490 on recipezaar. sometimes i don't always have 2 gallons of cumcumbers but will make if i have gathered enough for 1 gallon but i go ahead and make the syrup and save it and use it on the next batch. since the syrup has vinegar

amount that is ready in only 2 days.","993":"my mom bought what she thought at the time was the biggest stockpot ever in 1998, and this is the first thing she made in it. i've always loved it and i make it when i can in my own 16 quart pot! it freezes really well, so don't be afraid to make it all. cook the chicken a day ahead so you can refrigerate the broth to skim the fat off easier. thanks mom!!","994":"eggplant parmesan, an italian standby, is one of my favorite dishes. we developed this quick version so that i could have it more often. it\u2019s super low in carbs and fat, and you won\u2019t even miss the breading. - dr. mike moreno","995":"this is a great fruity tasting drink.","996":"ris lacoste was the chef at the 1789 restaurant in georgetown in washington dc for ten years, til she left to open her own place.  this salad was a favorite on the menu.  the cider vinaigrette recipe makes a lot--but you can keep it in the fridge for about two weeks.  bring it to room
