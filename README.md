Apicius is a Java application designed to help users find and keep track of recipes through its three main features: search, favorites, and pantry. 
The purpose of this project is to simplify the task of finding new recipes to try. Although there are many apps available that provide similar services,
most of them are locked behind subscription fees and other paywalls. This final state of this application would remain free and easy to use.
<br><br>
Apicius was built using MVC architecture and Java. JavaFX, ControlsFX, FXML, and CSS were used additionally to construct the UI. Our recipe data is stored in a DynamoDB
table hosted through AWS. On the other hand, user data (ex. favorites list, virtual pantry) is stored locally.
